This repository can be used to test Programming Challenge #1.

You can test your solution using the command:

mvn scala:run -DaddArgs="<path to executable>"

If your program outputs in a format other than just the result on the last line you may provide a regular expression with a single match group using:

mvn scala:run -DaddArgs="<path to executable>|--regex|Solution: (\d+)"

If you want to test a specific solution set you can run it with:

mvn scala:run -DaddArgs="<path to executable>|--test|1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"
